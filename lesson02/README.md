# Lesson 2 - Software Development Lifecycle

There are many different SDLC models. Testing is not isolated activity, it is
part of SDLC. In different environments and SDLC models testing is carried out
differently and at different stages of product development.

## Waterfall model

### Exercise: (15 minutes)

Read
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model

Answer the following questions:

* What are the key stages in waterfall SDLC model ?
* Where does testing fit in ?
* What are the problems wrt testing in waterfall model ?

Instructor will summarize the above questions.


### Exercise: (30 minutes)

* Work in groups of 5 people. We need 5 groups
* Each group is responsible for one step in the waterfall model
* Instructor is your Customer
* We are building the best calculator application
(it's up to you how to build and test it)

* Simulate (discuss) the activities in the waterfall model by interacting
with your customer and peer groups where necessary. Instructor will facilitate
the exercise.

* Take notes of the various stages in the waterfall model and how you work with
them



## Agile models

### Exercise: (15 minutes)

Read:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development

Answer the following questions:

* What are the key properties of agile methods ?
* Where does testing fit in ?
* What are the differences between Agile and Waterfall models
wrt testing and QA ?

Instructor will summarize the above questions.

### Exercise: (30 minutes)

* Work in groups of 5 people. 1 person per role
** customer
** requirements analyst
** designer
** developer
** tester

* Each group is a cross-functional team
* Each group is responsible to build the application alone
* You are building the best calculator application
(it's up to you how to build and test it)

* Discuss the activities in a simulated agile environment by interacting
with your customer and peers where necessary. Instructor will facilitate
the exercise.

* Take notes of the various iterations in the process and how you work with
them


## QA's involvement in both

One size doesn't fit all.

# Lesson 2 - Bug tracking

## Generic definition

A bug tracking system is a software application that keeps track of reported
software bugs in software development projects. Many bug tracking systems,
such as those used by most open source software projects, allow end-users to
enter bug reports directly. Other systems are used only internally in a company
or organization doing software development. Typically bug tracking systems are
integrated with other software project management applications. A bug tracking
system is usually a necessary component of a good software development
infrastructure, and consistent use of a bug or issue tracking system is
considered one of the "hallmarks of a good software team".

At Red Hat we say: "If it's not in Bugzilla, it's not a bug!"

## How to write a good bug report

### Exercise: (20 minutes)

* Work in pairs
* Answer the following question:
** What information does a bug report need to include ?


Share your answers with the class. We will discuss the answers after the
next exercise.


### Exercise: (40 minutes)

* Work alone.
* Fork this repo under your username in GitHub
* Select one of the following bugs (or another at your will):
** http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/12/17/facebook-is-bugging-me/
** http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/01/09/pedometer-bug-in-samsung-gear-fit-smartwatch/
** http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/01/07/2-barcode-related-bugs-in-myfitnesspal/
** http://atodorov.org/blog/2015/01/05/endless-loop-bug-candy-crush-saga-level-80/
* Create a GitHub issue inside your repository and describe the bug
you have selected.
* NOTE: Add URL link to the chosen problem in your bug report! (for reference purposes)


Instructor will examine your bug reports and explain what information
is vital and really important and what information not so much.


### Exercise: (20 minutes)

* Work in pairs
* Exchange URLs of your initial bug reports
* Review each-other's reports
* Make notes of the URL and what information is present (good)
or missing (bad) in the bug report!

Ask instructor for help if necessary.

Share the good and bad sides of the bug report with the class.


### Exercise: (10 minutes)

* Read the following articles:
https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates
https://help.github.com/articles/helping-people-contribute-to-your-project/

* Create an ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md inside your GitHub repository,
containing placeholders for important bug information
* Add the Steps to reproduce or How to test sections to your template
* Verify that the template works
* Create a new bug report, using the template, for the same issue that you
reported previously

Ask instructor for help if necessary.


### Exercise: (20 minutes)

* Work in pairs
* Exchange URLs of bug reports from previous exercise
* Review each-other's reports
* Make notes of the URL and what information is present (good)
or missing (bad) in the bug report!
* Answer the question:
** How good is the proposed ISSUE_TEMPLATE ?

Ask instructor for help if necessary.

Share your findings with the class.



### Homework:

Contribute an ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md to an open source project on GitHub.
Select one which you like or are familiar with (if possible).
Make a note of the URL of your pull request (for future reference).

You need to be at least somewhat familiar with the project so I'm
not going to propose projects to work on.
