# QA and Automation 101

In this course students will learn the basic theory behind software quality
assurance and test automation. More importantly they will learn how to think
like testers and analyze a given problem from various angles, often without
complete information available.

The theory lessons include exerices like writing a bug report or writing
test cases and test plans, sometimes in hypothetical environments, sometimes
using real software when possible.

In order to gain the maximum benefit of this course please clone this repo
and write down your answers to the exercises, links to bug reports and test
plans. These can be later shown to prospect employers.
