# Bug tracking

## Generic definition

A bug tracking system is a software application that keeps track of reported
software bugs in software development projects. Many bug tracking systems,
such as those used by most open source software projects, allow end-users to
enter bug reports directly. Other systems are used only internally in a company
or organization doing software development. Typically bug tracking systems are
integrated with other software project management applications. A bug tracking
system is usually a necessary component of a good software development
infrastructure, and consistent use of a bug or issue tracking system is
considered one of the "hallmarks of a good software team".

At Red Hat we say: "If it's not in Bugzilla, it's not a bug!"

Ask instructor for help if necessary.

Share the good and bad sides of the bug report with the class.


### Exercise: (10 minutes)

* Read the following articles:
 * https://github.com/blog/2111-issue-and-pull-request-templates
 * https://help.github.com/articles/helping-people-contribute-to-your-project/

* Create an `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` inside your GitHub repository,
containing placeholders for important bug information
* Add the Steps to reproduce or How to test sections to your template
* Verify that the template works
* Create a new bug report, using the template, for the same issue that you
reported previously

Ask instructor for help if necessary.


### Exercise: (20 minutes)

* Work in pairs
* Exchange URLs of bug reports from previous exercise
* Review each-other's reports
* Make notes of the URL and what information is present (good)
or missing (bad) in the bug report!
* Answer the question:
* How good is the proposed `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` ?

Ask instructor for help if necessary.

Share your findings with the class.



### Homework:

Contribute an `ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` to an open source project on GitHub.
Select one which you like or are familiar with (if possible).
Make a note of the URL of your pull request (for future reference).

You need to be at least somewhat familiar with the project so I'm
not going to propose projects to work on.
